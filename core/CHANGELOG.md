- Decrease memory footprint of SessionData values [#354](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/354)

FEATURES:

- TLS version 1.3 is available with most features but is not enabled by default.
  One notable omission is post-handshake authentication.  Scenarios where
  servers previously used renegotiation to conditionally request a certificate
  are not possible yet when `TLS13` is negotiated.  Users may enable the version
  in `supportedVersions` only when sure post-handshake authentication is not
  required.

API CHANGES:

- `SessionManager` implementations need to provide a `sessionResumeOnlyOnce`
  function to accomodate resumption scenarios with 0-RTT data.  The function is
  called only on the server side.
- Data type `SessionData` is extended with four new fields for TLS version 1.3.
  `SessionManager` implementations that serializes/deserializes `SessionData`
  values must deal with the new fields.
- New configuration parameters and constructors are added for TLS version 1.3
  but the API change should be backward compatible for most use-cases.
- Function `cipherExchangeNeedMoreData` has been removed.

- Enable X25519 in default parameters [#265](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/265)
- Checking EOF in bye [#262](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/262)

- Accepting hlint suggestions.

## Version 1.4.0

- Improve selection of server certificate and use "signature_algorithms" extension [#236](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/236)
- Change Bytes to ByteString and deprecate the Bytes type alias [#230](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/230)
- Session compression and SNI [#223](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/223)
- Deprecating ciphersuite_medium. Putting WARNING to ciphersuite_all since this includes RC4 [#153](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/153) [#222](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/222)
- Removing NPN [#214](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/214)
- Supporting RSAPSS defined in TLS 1.3 [#207](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/207)
- Supporting X25519 and X448 in the IES style. [#205](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/205)
- Strip leading zeros in DHE premaster secret [#201](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/201)

FEATURES:

- RSASSA-PSS signatures can be enabled with `supportedHashSignatures`.  This
  uses assignments from TLS 1.3, for example `(HashIntrinsic, SignatureRSApssSHA256)`.
- Diffie-Hellman with elliptic curves X25519 and X448: This can be enabled with
  `supportedGroups`, which also gives control over curve preference.
- ECDH with curve P-256 now uses optimized C implementation from package `cryptonite`.

API CHANGES:

- Cipher list `ciphersuite_medium` is now deprecated, users are advised to use
  `ciphersuite_default` or `ciphersuite_strong`.  List `ciphersuite_all` is kept
  for compatibility with old servers but this is discouraged and generates a
  warning (this includes RC4 ciphers, see [#153](https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-tls/pull/153)
  for reference).
- Support for NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation) has been removed. The replacement
  is ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation).
- Data type `SessionData` now contains fields for compression algorithm and
  client SNI.  A `SessionManager` implementation that serializes/deserializes
  `SessionData` values must deal with the new fields.
- Module `Network.TLS` exports a type alias named `Bytes` which is now deprecated.
  The replacement is to use strict `ByteString` directly.
